# Lead Creation Tests

8 tests covering lead creation scenarios.

## Happy Path

1. Create lead with required fields only
2. Create lead with all standard fields
3. Create lead with lead source picklist

## Validation

4. Attempt save without required fields
5. Enter only first name and attempt save
6. Enter valid email address

## Edge Cases

7. Enter special characters in name
8. Enter text with special characters
