## Happy Path

3. Create account with full billing address
4. Create account with industry and type picklists

## Edge Cases

5. Create account with long field values
6. Create account with boundary numeric values

## Validation

7. Attempt save without name
8. Create account and verify in list view
9. Cancel account creation with unsaved changes
